## How it works

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server at port [3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- `npm run build` - Builds the application in a `dist` folder
- `npm run preview` - Serves the build files (`dist` folder) locally at port [5000](http://localhost:3000/)

Note that if after this last command you do not see anything, you can use instead this other command:

- `npm run preview --host` - You should then be able to see your files locally at port [5000](http://localhost:3000/)

## A single p5.js sketch

```js
import '../css/style.css';
import { sketch } from 'p5js-wrapper';

sketch.setup = function () {
  createCanvas(800, 600);
};

sketch.draw = function () {
  background(127); // grey
  fill(255, 0, 0); // red
  noStroke();
  rectMode(CENTER);
  rect(width / 2, height / 2, 50, 50);
};

sketch.mousePressed = function () {
  console.log(`I am here at ${mouseX}:${mouseY}`);
};
```

And here the body of the html file:

```html
<body>
  <script type="module" src="/src/single_sketch.js"></script>
</body>
```

## Multiple p5.js sketches

If you want to use multiple sketches, you need to use a different syntax.

```js
import '../css/style.css';
import { p5 } from 'p5js-wrapper';

let sketch1 = new p5((p) => {
  p.setup = () => {
    const one = document.getElementById('one');
    p.createCanvas(one.clientWidth, one.clientHeight);
  };

  p.draw = () => {
    p.background(100);
  };
}, 'one');

// Sketch2
let sketch2 = new p5((p) => {
  p.setup = () => {
    const two = document.getElementById('two');
    p.createCanvas(two.clientWidth, two.clientHeight);
  };

  p.draw = () => {
    p.background(170);
  };
}, 'two');
```

This file is expecting two divs in the html file:

```html
<body>
  <script type="module" src="/src/multi_sketch.js"></script>
  <div id="one"></div>
  <div id="two"></div>
</body>
```

## Adding sound

Sound is an [experimental feature](https://github.com/makinteract/p5js-wrapper/blob/main/README_SOUND.md).

Examples usage:

```js
import { sketch } from 'p5js-wrapper';
import 'p5js-wrapper/sound';

import mysound from './mysound.mp3';

let soundEffect;

sketch.setup = function () {
  createCanvas(100, 100);
  soundEffect = loadSound(mysound);
};

sketch.draw = function () {
  background('#eeeeee');
};

// Play sound on click
sketch.mousePressed = function () {
  soundEffect.play();
};
```

This example assumes you have a file _mysound.mp3_ in the _src_ folder.
